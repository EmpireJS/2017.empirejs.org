                            Every year the Empire team ramps up, we try to highlight one of the things that makes New York City an amazing place to live, work, visit, and git push origin master in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This year we return to showcase the little language you know and love at the Academy of Medicine on museum mile, this October 12 and 13.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We're so excited that we're able to feature New York at its finest, and we're really looking forward to pushing Empire, JS, and Node.js towards another incredible year.

                                        <p>Until recently, design on the web has been limited to fragile, horizontal, and boxy layouts. Today there are new tools in CSS that can help us breathe new life into stale projects. Some of them are cutting edge, while others are quite mature yet still under-used. This talk is centered around the use of five emerging CSS tools: grid, shapes, transforms, viewport units, and blending modes. By the end, attendees will see practical examples of how to mix these tools together and turn them into novel, eye-catching compositions.</p>
                                        <p>Attendees will get a showcase of how these new digital techniques can be applied to the web by journeying back to the past—nearly 100 years—to one of the most notable periods in the history of design: Bauhaus modernism. During this period, design was highly influential yet gleefully experimental, with strict geometry, overlapping elements, and rotated text. Attendees will see works by artist Piet Mondrian, typographer Jan Tschichold, metal-worker Marianne Brandt, and more recreated or redesigned on screen, and optimized for the new medium of mobile devices.</p>

                                        <p>Having worked on a dynamic site translated into more than 20 languages, I am all to familiar with the layout havoc caused by localized content: English content translated into German can be twice as long as the original, and Japanese can be half as long. In this talk, I will demonstrate CSS techniques to build pages flexible enough to handle copy columns with differing heights, strange centering, and grid-breaking content boxes. The secret here is that these enterprise CSS techniques apply to large differences in content sizes; such as from database-driven sites, user-generated content, or unknown viewport sizes.</p>

                                        <p>Databending, also known as "the artistic misuse of digital information", is a largely unexplored and highly creative domain in glitch art and new media. In the context of programming, databending is a fun way to dive into a number of interesting concepts, such as audio processing, buffers, and media streaming, not normally covered in the day to day of web development.</p>
                                        <p>This talk consists of two parts: a high level overview of various databending techniques, and a demonstration of databending with Javascript in the browser, specifically focused on running images and video through audio processes to create new experiences in real time.</p>
                                        <p>There is value in exploring uncharted territories and going against what the documentation states. I want you to leave this talk with a newfound appreciation for occasionally bending the rules. We normally want to follow the rules because it makes things simpler, but in this case ignoring them allows us to discover things that we may never have otherwise imagined.</p>

                                        <p>Constant internet access has become ingrained in our society. Consistent connectivity has been a blessing for learning, and will undoubtedly continue to drive innovation. However, with 12 percent of the United States without internet at home, many cannot access their important financial and health data, look for employment, or even keep up with current events. Many are forced to rely on cellular data or even public spaces offering internet access.</p>
                                        <p>In short, internet connectivity places users into silos, with the connected silo being easy to fall out of, but difficult to break into.</p>

Using new technologies like Electron, Ionic, and React Native this talk will focus on using freely available tech to build on the work we’ve already done, while improving access to our products.</p>

                                        <p>Reactive data structures are intuitive and flexible. But they’re not always enough structure for complex client applications. How can we scale understandability? This talk presents three Vue.js techniques: partially applied utility functions, unmounted data-store components, and a hybrid technique that can give us the benefits of each. You’ll learn what each technique is good for — and where each can trip you up. Whether you use Vue or React or even JQuery day-to-day, you’ll come away with a better understanding of how to leverage reactivity for understandability when understandability gets hard.</p>

                                        <p>With the introduction of Progressive Web Apps and web platform APIs such as persistent storage, payments, and geolocation, the web platform is taking on native apps. A Progressive Web App combines the best parts both a web app and a native app. You browse to a Progressive Web App just like you browse to any other website. It lives at a URL, can be indexed by search engines, and can be linked to from anywhere else on the web. As you continue to use a Progressive Web App it gains additional native app-like capabilities. For example, the app could be installed to the home screen on your device. You might also grant the app the ability to send you push notifications, or the ability to access your camera, your microphone, or other device resources.</p>
                                        <p>One important aspect of Progressive Web Apps is the concept of building your app to be Offline First. With an Offline First approach, you design your app for the most resource-constrained environment first. This approach provides a consistent user experience whether the user's device has no connectivity, limited connectivity, or great connectivity. One of the biggest benefits of Offline First apps is that they can be very fast, as they provide zero-latency access to content and data stored directly on the device.</p>
                                        <p>The Service Worker API can do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to storing content and assets for Offline First Progressive Web Apps. A bigger challenge can be storing and sync'ing your app's data. One of the best answers today for offline sync for Progressive Web Apps is a combination of Apache CouchDB (an open source document database), Hoodie (an open source Node.js backend for Offline First apps), and PouchDB (an open source JavaScript database that syncs). This stack can provide you with the starting point for your own Progressive Web App mobile backend and frontend, and it's entirely open source! You'll leave this workshop having built a fully-functional Offline First Progressive Web Apps using Polymer, Web Components, Service Workers, Apache CouchDB, Hoodie, and PouchDB.</p>

                                        <p>These days, most developers (finally!) test their JavaScript. In fact, many of us write so many tests we often feel overwhelmed by massive suites of erratic, inconsistent, and redundant tests. Worse, because tests play second-fiddle to production code, it can be hard to make the time to identify &amp; address root cause problems before they metastasize throughout our projects.</p>
                                        <p>I've been helping teams test their JavaScript for nearly a decade, and I've distilled what I've learned into <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/test-smells">30 "smells"</a>— indicators of potential test design problems, each paired with an example exercise. Attendees are encouraged to come to the workshop with their most painful test in hand and to share them with the group. Together, we'll collectively identify each test's root cause problems and how to address them in a systematic, repeatable way.</p>

                                        <p>JavaScript is probably the most famous example of a prototype-based language. But what is prototype-based programming? Where did it all come from? What's the big deal? Why is JavaScript's version of it the way it is?</p>
                                        <p>Prototype-oriented programming has been around for over 30 years now. From its earliest days as a series of language extensions for various languages, to the release of Self and the compiler technology it developed that's used by Chrome and Node.js, to the rise of JavaScript and beyond -- it has been an incredibly influential take on the concept of object-orientation, and withstood the test of time against its class-based counterparts.</p>
                                        <p>A Brief History of Prototypes will tell the story of this programming paradigm, the decisions and mistakes, the technological breakthroughs it led, its explosive rise in popularity on the back of ECMAScript, and puts it all in context with the way we use prototype-based languages today.</p>

                                        <p>Over the years, I've shipped applications to hundreds upon thousands upon millions of users devices. When a crash or a runtime error occurs, the problem is often due to a bug that stems from a simple developer error, such as passing an array where a method expects a string, or trying to access a property on a null object.</p>
                                        <p>These problems were huge when writing apps in Objective-C, due to the dynamic nature of the language. This all changed in 2014 when Apple announced Swift, a static, strongly typed language. At Venmo, we reduced our crash rate drastically whenever we introduced more Swift code, because it forced developers to make the appropriate decisions when typing our code. Gone were the days of null pointer exceptions and trying to add 2to "username".</p>
                                        <p>When moving over to using React Native, I yearned for static types in JavaScript. Two big open source projects exist to help JavaScript developers with static typing, Flow from Facebook and Typescript from Microsoft. These two projects not only prevent engineers from writing bugs that would blow up at runtime, they both come with a vast set of developer tooling to help them be more efficient, instead of slow them down.</p>
                                        <p>This talk will look at the state of static typing in JavaScript, looking at what kinds of bugs that Flow and Typescript prevent, as well as take a look at the future of static typing in JavaScript, exploring projects such as ReasonML. We'll look at how these tools can assist developers in creating awesome, scaleable, future-proof JavaScript apps.</p>

                                        <p>Should English continue to be the lingua franca of programming? Think about if, else, for, while, break – to most of you, these keywords have obvious meanings; but to any non-English speaker who is learning to code, these are merely symbols that must be memorized. We have talked a lot about internationalization and localization for the products we're building, so why aren't we applying the same concepts to our industry? Today, English is still a barrier of entry to tech. Many people still regard fluency of English as a sign of competency. Inferiority complex is still common among the developers who speak English as a second language.</p>
                                        <p>In this talk, you will get a glimpse of what it's like to code in a foreign language. Together, we will explore the advantages of being able to collaborate in one language, the dangerous implications of accepting that as the default, and how we can do better as a community.</p>

                                        <p>Functions-as-a-service reject the metaphor of a server and free developers to design smaller, simpler services. On the surface, it is a beautifully simple idea. But, because building serverless-y apps is very new, so are the tools to navigate it. This path can be fraught with complexity and often requires a high degree of domain-specific knowledge about proprietary systems. In this talk, Angelina will teach you a new approach to architecting applications with plain text using https://arc.codes to create apps in minutes and deploy within seconds, taking advantage of all the benefits of functions-as-a-service: a high degree of isolation, the ability to deploy systems in seconds with zero downtime, and consistent availability regardless of load.</p>

In this workshop we'll go through the process of breaking down a problem into bit-size chunks, how to work with (sometimes messy) APIs, and create a quality user experience in a chat app. Written in Node.js, we’ll also cover the ins and outs of the language and best practices for writing maintainable code. This 8 part workshop is organized to be self-paced, where each step is an self-contained accomplishment. Our goal is to send off the participants with a working Slack bot and the knowledge to continue fleshing out their bot to a fully shippable Slack App.</p>

                                        <p>1) Using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk to deploy monolithic Node.js code and run it directly on EC2 instances, behind an Application Load Balancer 2) Using Serverless framework to deploy Node.js functions to Amazon Lambda, behind an API Gateway 3) Using Amazon ECS to deploy containerized Node.js microservices to a cluster of Docker hosts behind an Application Load Balancer</p>
                                        <p>The workshop will cover the differences between these different architectural approaches, and their advantages and disadvantages in different scenarios. The goal is that developers gain a basic hands on understanding of how to setup all three deployment approaches, and learn how to determine which one best serves the needs of their specific application. Attendees are expected to come to the workshop with access to their own AWS account which they will use to complete the workshop.</p>
